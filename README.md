# base64
A tiny implementation of a simply base64 algorithm in a few languages

## Implementations

* Ruby
  * Has tests
  * Packaged as a gem
  * Mostly functional-ish, each-slice throws that off.
  * Try rake test
* Scala
  * No tests
  * No sbt, waiting for pants
  * possibly not working
* Clojure
  * Has tests
  * Packaged as a lib
  * lein is pretty great! (try lein test or lein run)
* Python
  * Tried to make an egg, gave up
  * Still very imperative and terrible
  * Should probably add tests
* Go
  * Attempted; failed
* Rust
  * Attempted; failed
